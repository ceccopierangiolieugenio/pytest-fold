- There are only three outcomes: 'passed', 'failed', 'skipped'
- Most tests are made up of three phases ("when"): 'setup', 'call', 'teardown'
- The actual test outcome is shown during the 'call' phase:
  - for 'passed' tests, all three phases show outcome = 'passed'
  - for 'failed' tests, only the 'call' phase shows outcome = 'failed'; 'setup' and 'teardown' show 'passed'
  - for 'failed' tests, the traceback info is located in the "longreprtext" field
- Some tests only have two phases:
  - for 'skipped' tests, only 'setup' and 'teardown' exist
  - for 'skipped' tests, 'setup' phase has outcome = 'skipped'
- Tests with a warning are 'passed' tests (outcome='passed' for all three phases)
- stdout, stderr and stdlog info is contained in the 'call' phase only
- If a test results in 'error', no stdout/stderr/stdlog will be shown, just the error msg

- All the above notwithstanding, pytest still marks tests with a final category of one of the following, and then sends to console: 
KNOWN_TYPES = (
    "failed",
    "passed",
    "skipped",
    "deselected",
    "xfailed",
    "xpassed",
    "warnings",
    "error",
)

WILL POSSIBLY NEED:
FIRSTLINE
LASTLINE
WARNINGS_SUMMARY
SHORT_TEST_SUMMARY_INFO
TEST_SESSION_STARTS
